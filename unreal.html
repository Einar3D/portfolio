<h2>Unreal Engine</h2>
  
<p>It's been numerous months since I've tinkered with Unreal Engine, and I've spent considerable time improving my abilities in Blender, Substance Painter, and Gimp, so I would be excited to a look at UE5, a version I have not used yet.
</p>

<p>The fairly dated samples below demonstrate the approach I took for learning Unreal, which was exporting the UE skeleton to Blender, rigging the character, then re-importing it.  I was able to create simple melee attack animations in Blender and use UE's 3rd person controls for gameplay.  Furthermore, setting up the 3D environment was fairly easy, and creating the hitboxes for proper collisions was not a problem.</p>

<p>Another important gameplay aspect I spent significant time experimenting with was artificial intelligence for NPC's, or non playable characters. The behavior tree UI is a friendly tool that I would be excited to learn more about, if the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>I expect to revisit Unreal Engine soon and create new, higher quality 3D environments to showcase my improved 3D modeling and learn how to program the scene and make it more interactive.</p>
