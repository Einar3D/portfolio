<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Greetings,</p> 

<p>Thank you for visiting my humble website. I created these webpages as an exercise to learn about front-end web development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  Right now, it's just a way for me to continue learning about 3D modeling which is pretty fun.  I would like to create some high quality content in the near future.</p>
