<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Greetings,</p> 

<p>I'm originally from the northeast USA.  Not long ago, I became interested in Blender, Unreal Engine, and Substance Painter to practice 3D modeling and video game development.  I still have a lot to learn but if I could be of any assistance I would be very excited to help out.</p>
