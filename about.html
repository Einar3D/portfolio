<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Greetings,</p> 

<p>Thank you for visiting my humble website. I created these webpages as an exercise to learn about front-end web development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  Right now, it's just a way for me to continue learning about 3D modeling which is pretty fun.  I would like to create some high quality content in the near future.</p>

<p>In terms of 3D art, I have basic knowledge of</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blender</li>
  <li>Substance Painter</li>
  <li>GIMP</li>
  <li>Unreal Engine</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Creating 3D environments in Unreal Engine, with assets from Blender, is a process I am familiar with.  Further, I have practical experience with setting up artificial intelligence via behavior trees in Unreal Engine 4, for 3rd person combat scenarios, similar to Dark Souls III.  
</p>

<p>The topology for many of my models can be viewed at <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Artists/Mark-Salazar?referral=Mark-Salazar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbosquid</a>, where a wireframe image is included for each asset.</p>

<p>I am currently interested in an entry level 3D artist position, or similar, where I could provide valuable assistance to a team and learn on the job.  As an international applicant, I would also be able to work at a very reasonable salary. Lastly, I am a dual citizen, so I could work in the USA.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
