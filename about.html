<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>
Thanks for visiting my page.  I hope these scenes provided a few moments of entertainment.  Perhaps you appreciate some of the beautiful artwork and elegant design found in various video games over the past few decades.  My aim is to learn some video game related skills in a fun way and highlight my favorites.
</p>

<p>
I am still a relative beginner.  Since January 2021 I've been playing around with Blender, Unreal Engine 4, and some additional programs to learn programming and design.  I dedicate some time in the morning and then go to my full time job. </p>

<p>
If you have any suggestions, comments, or would even like to provide a show of support, it would be greatly appreciated. 
</p>

<p>
Some of my 3D models can be purchased on Turbosquid, <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Artists/mark-from-nj?referral=mark-from-nj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'll be updating this page shortly to provide more information.

</p>

<p>Thank you.
