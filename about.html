<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Greetings,</p> 

<p>As a hobby, I learned Blender and other programs to practice 3D modeling and related activities.  In addition, I coded this website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I am very interested in finding an opportunity to work professionally in a project related to, for example, graphics or front end web development.</p>

<p>
If I could be of any assistance, please let me know.  Any suggestions, comments, or support would be greatly appreciated. Some of my 3D models could be purchased at Turbosquid.com by clicking <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Artists/Mark-Salazar?referral=Mark-Salazar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.  Also, a small donation could be made <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=37QDTGWL9UE2U">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website,
</p>

<p>Einar Salazar</p>
