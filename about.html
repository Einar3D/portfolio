</div>

<p>A native of New Jersey, I graduated from Rutgers with a degree in economics.  Around 2019, I started becoming interested programming with an emphasis towards video games.</p>

  <p>
Since then I've had the privilege of learning web development, 3D modeling, animation, and Unreal Engine 4.  Although I am not expert in these fields, I have a decent understanding of many important concepts and techniques.  My objective is to reach a sufficiently high skill level so I could begin to explore professional opportunities.  
</p>

<p>I have, at a minimum, a basic understanding of the following concepts:</p>
