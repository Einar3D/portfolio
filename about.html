  Hello!
</p>

<p>
I'm Mark from New Jersey, USA.  I graduated from Rutgers with a degree in economics.  I worked at a large law firm in New York City until 2018.  Late that year, I decided to take a chance and moved to Colombia, where my family is from, because I had a strong desire to explore this small, amazing country.  After a glorious year of traveling and working on my Spanish, I started working at a call center in Bogotá.  There I worked for the Lexmark customer service campaign.  Eventually I switched to another campaign, where I assisted United Healthcare members.

In 2019, I became interested programming, with a slight emphasis towards video games.  I honestly didn't know anything about the current technology.  I was a bit skeptical and quite ignorant.  I began by learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Kahn Academy, a great learning platform for kids.  I had learned about KA by watching the Colbert Report on Comedy Central.  Someone from the Kahn foundation was interviewed one night, and when me and some buddies checked out the history <em>crash course</em> lessons, we enjoyed it immensely. I really appreciated the quality and nobility of this non profit foundation.  So, in Colombia I pondered about what I should do in my free time and I discovered the computer programming section of KA and learned some valuable programming concepts such as object oriented programming.  Only when I decided to begin my own portfolio website did I realize the code in KA was not applicable to creating my own web site.  After some initial disappointment, I moved on to Mozilla's developer network, which KA had recommended. Mozilla's page contains a wonderful JavaScript tutorial.  I really enjoyed the canvas element for drawing and animation, although I soon learned it was practically obsolete.  For a while, I was stuck, and not knowing what to do, I decided to go back to Kahn Academy and learn math, in spanish this time.  I improved my trigonometry and algebra skills, which I felt might come in handy later on.

After moving to beautiful Cali for a short while, I came back to Bogotá and met a young fellow who told me about Blender 3D modling software after I explained to him that I was interested in programming and video games. Wow.  What a game changer for me.  That was the beginning of a deep dive, from my point of view, into the technology field.  I quickly learned about Unreal Engine 4 because I googled Mortal Kombat X and how it was developed.  Since then it's been an intense learning experience which still continues to this day.  At this point I have narrowed down my focus to 3D modeling, animation, rigging, and Unreal Engine 4.  All of these skills complement one another and there are many more sub-skills and techniques which I utilize to produce work that I'm happy with.  Also, I must mention Youtube, which has become an integral part of my education with its vast library of tutorials from highly skilled professionals. 
</p>

<p>
Confident, pleased with my progress, and looking to gain some professional experience, I am searching for small projects where I could continue to learn but also make a little bit of income to keep things moving forward.  Perhaps I could even do this full time or freelance.  Who knows?  That would be a dream come true.
