<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Greetings,</p> 

<p>Thank you for visiting my humble website.  Not long ago, I became interested in video game development, which led me to find out about Blender, Unreal, and other interesting software.  Although I'm still a novice, it's been fun creating 3D models, textures, and some programming.</p>
